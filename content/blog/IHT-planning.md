## How to Stay Ahead of Changes in UK Inheritance Tax Rules

Inheritance Tax (IHT) remains a concern for many families—especially with thresholds frozen and asset values rising. Key steps include:

-   Using your annual gifting allowance (£3,000 per person per year).
-   Passing on your main residence with the residence nil rate band (£175,000 per person).
-   Creating trusts or family investment companies, where appropriate.
-   Reviewing wills and nominations regularly.

Consult a regulated adviser to ensure your plan reflects current legislation and future changes.
