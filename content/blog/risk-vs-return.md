## What Every Investor Should Know

Every investment decision involves a trade-off: higher potential returns usually come with higher risks. Understanding this relationship helps you:

-   Avoid overreaction during market dips.
-   Set realistic expectations for performance.
-   Align your portfolio with your time horizon and financial goals.

Risk doesn’t just mean volatility—it includes inflation risk, liquidity risk, and behavioural risk. Diversifying and staying disciplined are key to managing these risks over time.
