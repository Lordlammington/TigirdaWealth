## For Resilient Investment Portfolio

Asset allocation—how your money is split between different asset classes—is the single biggest driver of portfolio performance. A resilient allocation:

-   Spreads risk across equities, bonds, alternatives, and cash.
-   Matches your risk profile (e.g. cautious, balanced, adventurous).
-   Adapts over time—as you approach retirement, for example, you may reduce exposure to volatility.

Regularly reviewing your allocation helps keep your investments aligned with your life stage and goals.
