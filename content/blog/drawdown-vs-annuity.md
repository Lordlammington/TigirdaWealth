## Choosing the Right Retirement Income Strategy

When itâ€™s time to start drawing your pension, you typically choose between:

-   Drawdown: Keeping your pension invested and drawing income as needed. Offers flexibility but comes with investment risk.
-   Annuity: A guaranteed income for life (or a set period). Offers security but less flexibility.

Many retirees choose a blend of both. The right approach depends on your health, lifestyle needs, and risk tolerance.
