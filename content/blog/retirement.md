## How to Assess Your Pension Health

To assess your pension health, start by answering:

-   How much do I need to retire comfortably?
-   How much have I already saved—and where is it invested?
-   Am I making full use of allowances (e.g. £60,000 annual pension contribution limit)?

Use tools like pension calculators or seek regulated advice to create a clear retirement roadmap. Review regularly—especially after major life events or policy changes.
